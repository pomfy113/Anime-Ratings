<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'll categorize this stuff later. I have plenty to talk about.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, I wanted to make something easy for me to for going through
    seasonal anime. There's ways to do it like, say... Anichart comes to mind,
    or going through individual anime, but I wanted sheer convenience. So it
    led to this.
</p>
<p>
    I still have a lot to do to make it more useful for others' uses. There's
    stuff involving fair use I need to abide by, but my aim isn't to make money.
    It was mostly finding something I wanted to make and use regularly and do it.

<h1>Changes</h1>
I'll need to put this on a scrollable thing later

                Changelog added. I think I should have done this earlier to
                detail the changes over time. Retroactively do changelog?
