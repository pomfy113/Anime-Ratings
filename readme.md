# Our Anime List
This project was made to consolidate all the information from several anime information sites at once.

## Getting Started
### Accessing the Site
The project is up and running at Heroku! If you would like to visit it, [click this link](http://our-anime-list-fc.herokuapp.com/). Because of how Heroku works, please allow some time for the site to get up and running.

### Prerequisites
Most of the things needed should be in the folder already. If you have any issues, please feel free to contact me

### Running Locally
To get it running on your local device, all you need to do is:
1. Go to your terminal
2. Head to where you put the folder in
3. Use `node install` to install dependencies  if needed
4. Run `node app.js` on the terminal
5. Open `localhost:3000`

And voila! You're good to go
