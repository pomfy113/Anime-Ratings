# OurAnimeChart
## About
This project was originally made to consolidate all the information from several anime information sites at once. Now it's more for ease of finding what's worth looking into season per season.

###Why?
Mostly for my and my Discord groups' convenience. We were tired of looking at multiple sites and clicking through everything just to find out what's worth looking into that season. I asked them what features they wanted the most, and made their wants a reality.

## ToDo
Mostly clean-up and styling. All the major stuff is working now; just need to make it look presentable.

## Getting Started
### Accessing the Site
The project is up and running at Herok! If you would like to visit it, [click this link](http://ouranimechart.herokuapp.com/). Because of how Heroku works, please allow some time for the site to get up and running.

### Prerequisites
Most of the things needed should be in the folder already. If you have any issues, please feel free to contact me

### Running Locally
To get it running on your local device, all you need to do is:
1. Go to your terminal
2. Head to where you put the folder in
3. Use `node install` to install dependencies  if needed
4. Run `node app.js` on the terminal
5. Open `localhost:3000`

And voila! You're good to go
